> 🧠 Self-curating, navigable, context-budget-aware **agent memory** that judges your session for
> what's worth keeping — with no vector database, no embedding pipeline, and no server. Just Markdown
> in a git repo. Works as a Claude Code plugin.

Mnemex (from *Mnemosyne*, the personification of memory, + the engineering suffix *-ex*) is a
specification **and** a Claude Code plugin for capturing the durable knowledge an agent produces —
the **what** (domain facts) and the **how** (the patterns and review decisions that govern good
work in a domain) — into a plain-Markdown graph that lives in a git repository, organizes itself
into human-like memory tiers (**🔥 hot / 🌤️ warm / ❄️ cold**), and forgets what stops being useful while
protecting what is structurally important.

It is designed to give agents long-term, navigable, *context-budget-aware* memory **without a vector
database, without an embedding pipeline, and without a server.** Routing is structural (folder +
index traversal), decay is lazy (computed, never swept), and every mutation is a reviewable git
commit.

</div>

### ⏱️ 60-second quickstart

Everything starts at the **OpenMnemex Console** — a local web app that opens in your browser:

```bash
uvx openmnemex          # or: pip install openmnemex && openmnemex
```

From the Console: create (or open) a graph, then go to **Add agents** — it detects the coding
agents on your machine and connects each with **one click**. For **Claude Code** the Console
recommends the **plugin** route instead (richer: auto-capture hooks, the full skill set) and
shows you the two commands to run inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kritird/OpenMnemex        # inside Claude Code
/plugin install mnemex@mnemex-marketplace
```

Then just work: the first read on the empty graph offers to **seed it from a repo/docs** — or skip
that and it fills episodically as you go. Prefer the terminal? Every step has a CLI equivalent
(`openmnemex install --agent <agent> --init-graph --yes`) — see [Install](#-install) below and
[`docs/agent-setup.md`](docs/agent-setup.md); [`docs/user-journey.md`](docs/user-journey.md) has
the day-to-day loop.

## 💡 Why this exists

Agents are excellent at producing knowledge inside a session and terrible at keeping it. The two
common fixes both have sharp costs:

| ❌ Common fix | 💸 The cost it carries |
|---|---|
| **Stuff everything into context** | Context bloat, cost, and attention dilution. |
| **Embed everything into a vector store** | Infrastructure, an embedding pipeline, an index to operate, and opaque retrieval you cannot read or diff. |

Mnemex takes a **third path**. Knowledge is **files**. Navigation is the **filesystem plus small index
files** you read in chunks. Relevance is a **number you compute on demand** from a usage log, modeled
on the *Ebbinghaus forgetting curve* and *spaced repetition*: things used often stay visible and
cheap to reach; things unused drift down the tiers and, eventually, die — unless something still
points at them. The result is a knowledge base that behaves like memory rather than a landfill.

## 🧠 It remembers like you do — automatically

You don't consciously decide to memorize everything that happens in a conversation. Your mind
quietly judges, in the background, what was *significant* and what was noise — and keeps the former
without you ever asking it to. **Mnemex is auto-memory in exactly that sense.** You do the work; it
watches the session and decides what is worth keeping.

When a session ends, Mnemex looks at what actually happened and asks the questions a person would:

- **Is this relevant?** — does it generalize beyond this one conversation, or was it throwaway scaffolding?
- **Is this significant?** — a durable domain fact or a hard-won review decision, versus an incidental detail?
- **Is this novel?** — something the graph doesn't already know, versus a restatement of what's there?

It **captures the knowledge that passes** and **ignores the rest.** Concretely, capture extracts
candidate atoms from the session and scores each one `now` / `later` / `not-needed` — the explicit
keep / defer / forget judgment. The author doesn't curate, tag, or decide what to file away; that
salience call is Mnemex's job, and what survives later rises or decays on its own through the
🔥 hot / 🌤️ warm / ❄️ cold tiers as it gets used or stops being used.

And just like your own memory, being *frequently recalled* is not the same as being *still true*. Mnemex
tracks that too, on a **separate axis**: every fact carries a `verified` clock, and when it hasn't been
re-confirmed within a horizon you set (`freshness_ttl_days`), it's flagged ⏳ **stale** the next time it's
read — even if it's hot — so the agent re-checks it against the source instead of confidently repeating
something outdated. Confirm it's unchanged and the clock resets for one cheap stamp; find it's wrong and
the correction flows back in through capture. (Full model:
[`docs/freshness-and-revalidation.md`](docs/freshness-and-revalidation.md).)

The author doesn't worry about any of this. You build; Mnemex remembers what mattered — and flags what may
have gone stale. 🧭

> The judgment is reviewable, not a black box: capture stages locally and you can inspect or
> un-stage anything (`mnx-status`, `mnx-capture --drop`) before a deliberate `mnx-promote` commits
> it to the shared graph. *Automatic, but never unaccountable.*

## 🪙 Built to burn fewer tokens

A knowledge base is only worth having if *reading* it is cheap. The two usual approaches quietly tax
every single query: stuffing prior knowledge into the prompt pays for the whole pile on every turn, and
vector-RAG pastes the top-*k* retrieved chunks into context each time you ask. Both get **more** expensive
as the corpus grows.

Mnemex is architected the other way: **tier is literally read cost**, so the tokens a read spends scale
with the *path you take*, not the *size of the graph*. You navigate by reading tiny index heads and open
only the handful of node bodies you actually commit to.

| 🎯 Mechanism | 🪙 Why it spends fewer tokens |
|---|---|
| 🧭 **Route, don't retrieve** | You read one-line index heads to *pick a path* (org → team → cluster). Nothing is pasted into context on spec. |
| 🔥 **Hot = top-K, chunk 1** | The routing head is capacity-bounded — it stays small even in a huge graph, so the baseline read is bounded regardless of node count. |
| 📚 **Chunked tier reads, stop early** | Read **Hot** first; it's usually enough. **Warm/Cold** only on demand. You rarely load a whole index, never the whole graph. |
| 🏷️ **Match on denormalized summaries** | Each index row carries the node's `summary`+`aliases`, so you *match without opening a single node body*. |
| 🔎 **Expand only on commit** | Load only the bodies you'll actually use, within a per-hop token budget — beam search, not "load every neighbor". |
| 🗑️ **Self-pruning** | Decay + death keep the routing surface small over time — no landfill of dead knowledge to page through. |
| ⏳ **Trust the fresh, re-check only the stale** | A verified fact is used as-is; you don't re-derive known knowledge from scratch — only a *stale* atom triggers a re-check. |

> 💡 **The payoff:** a read is a few small index-head reads **plus only the node bodies you commit to** —
> not the corpus, not a wall of retrieved chunks. Retrieval stays cheap as the graph grows into the
> thousands of nodes, which is exactly where naive context-stuffing and RAG get most expensive.

Three kinds of file, three jobs (this separation is the core of the design):

| File | Holds | Mutated when |
|---|---|---|
| 📄 **Node** (`*.md`) | Pure knowledge: summary, body, edges, provenance. | Only on author / re-author / supersede / death / revalidation (`verified`). |
| 🗂️ **Index** (`index.md`) | Derived navigation + materialized memory state (strength, tier). | Only by the maintenance pass (and write-apply). |
| 📝 **Registry** (`registry.md`) | Append-only usage stamps. | Appended on confirmed use; truncated only by checkpointed compaction. |

## ⚙️ The four operations

Four of Mnemex's skills are memory operations, each fronted by a slash command. They map to the verbs of
a memory system (two more skills, `mnx-init` and `mnx-status`, handle setup and status — see below).
Knowledge writing is split **capture / promote** — the `git commit` vs `git push`/PR of memory.

| 🎛️ Command | Skill | What it does | Mutates? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔍 `/mnemex:mnx-read` | `mnx-read` | Route → read tiered indexes in chunks → **overlay** local staged atoms → expand only needed nodes → **flag stale atoms** for revalidation → emit a **usage manifest** → append stamps for nodes actually used. | Registry append only (pure w.r.t. knowledge). |
| ✍️ `/mnemex:mnx-capture` | `mnx-capture` | Capture the **current session** (artifact + human review points) → extract atoms → **score** each `now/later/not-needed` → **stage** locally with self-sufficient provenance. Cheap, local, no lock. Also **curates** staging: `--drop <id>` / `--discard-all` un-stage (review via `mnx-status`) — the local un-stage and the hard-cap escape valve. | No — writes only the local staging tier. |
| 🚀 `/mnemex:mnx-promote` | `mnx-promote` | The deliberate merge: flush stamps → **reconcile + merge** staged atoms (clean-context sub-agent, HITL on contradictions) → **consolidate** the post-merge graph (decay/re-tier/death/edge-hygiene/budget) → doctor → push → clear staging. If a push fails after commit, `--retry-push` lands the existing commit (never re-merges). | Yes — gated, atomic, one commit. |
| 🩺 `/mnemex:mnx-doctor` | `mnx-doctor` | The validator: checks every invariant (edge targets exist, index matches nodes, denormalized copies are fresh, reverse map consistent, no dangling edges) and can self-heal derived files. | Repair mode only. |

The maintenance pass (`mnx-consolidate`) is **internal** — the back half of `mnx-promote`, with no
standalone slash command.

### 🏗️ Bootstrap a whole graph from an existing repo — in one command

**You don't start from an empty graph.** Point Mnemex at a repo you already have and it builds the memory
for you:

```bash
/mnemex:mnx-ingest github.com/acme/payments-service     # or a local path
```

`mnx-ingest` reads an entire **code or documentation repository** — no live session needed — and turns years
of accumulated docs, ADRs, API contracts, and code comments into a live, connected knowledge graph. It does
**not** dump the repo into a vector store. It **distills**: an LLM mines each file for the durable *facts*
and *decisions* worth keeping, **collapses the same fact stated five different ways into one well-sourced
node** (entity resolution), and wires the `[[wiki-links]]` between them — so what lands is *distilled
memory*, not a RAG index over your source.

And it stays honest at scale:

- **Two gates, not a thousand.** Approve the scope + routing map once up front, then a single bulk summary at
  the end — **never** per-atom review. A monorepo is one decision, not ten thousand.
- **Re-runnable and idempotent.** Run it again after the repo changes and it imports **only the diff**; a
  deleted source file surfaces as an *orphan candidate* for you to judge — never silent auto-death.
- **Safe by construction.** Ingest **only stages** (promote stays the sole writer), **never reads secrets**,
  and **never mutates the source**.
- **Higher recall for free.** A shared **gleaning** pass ("what did I miss?") lifts extraction completeness —
  and it improves ordinary session capture too.

Everything downstream — reconcile, merge, the wiki mesh, consolidate, doctor, push — is the **same pipeline**
your daily captures already flow through. Full model: [`docs/corpus-ingestion.md`](docs/corpus-ingestion.md).

### 🖥️ The Console — where you meet your graph

The **OpenMnemex Console** is the human side of Mnemex: agents write the graph, the Console is
where *you* start, look, and manage. One command opens it; from there you create or open graphs
and hook up your agents (the **Add agents** screen) — and it draws every graph on your machine as
a living picture: node **size and teal depth** show how heavily each atom is used, **amber/red
rings** show what's due or overdue for a re-check, hollow purple dots are staged captures, dashed
ghosts are `[[links]]` nobody has written yet.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/viewer-canvas.png" alt="The OpenMnemex Console canvas" width="720">
</p>

```bash
uvx openmnemex     # or: pip install openmnemex && openmnemex
```

Click any node for its mesh and full rendered atom; search the graph; open the **revalidation
queue** (what needs re-checking, soonest first); toggle the **health overlay** (doctor findings
pinned on the canvas); or drag the **time scrubber** to watch how the graph would age over the
next months. Every number is computed by the same engine the agents use — and over knowledge it's
**view-only forever**: browsing never changes a file (the Console's only writes are creating a
new empty graph and, on your click, an agent's own connection config). Full tour:
[`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md).

Two further skills round out the surface. `/mnemex:mnx-init` is the setup/preflight: it **binds** a
project (or your user account) to a graph repo — creating and scaffolding a new graph, or pointing at an
existing one — and is what every other command resolves first. For a git-remote graph it runs a
read-only reachability/auth pre-flight before binding and, on failure, offers a no-auth local-folder
fallback. `/mnemex:mnx-status` is a read-only at-a-glance status: what graph is bound, its kind,
node/tier counts per team, pending usage stamps, last gc, and a health summary. See
[`docs/binding-and-graph-sync.md`](docs/binding-and-graph-sync.md).

Phase-by-phase breakdowns are in
[`docs/skills-commands-hooks.md`](docs/skills-commands-hooks.md) and
[`docs/maintenance-pass-algorithm.md`](docs/maintenance-pass-algorithm.md).

## 📦 Install

**Start with the Console** — it guides everything else:

```bash
# 1. Open the OpenMnemex Console (installs on first run; needs Python 3.9+):
uvx openmnemex                      # or: pip install openmnemex && openmnemex

# 2. In the Console: create your first graph (or open an existing folder).

# 3. In the Console → "Add agents": one click connects each detected agent.
#    For Claude Code it recommends the plugin (auto-capture hooks, skills) and
#    shows these two commands to run inside Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add kritird/OpenMnemex
/plugin install mnemex@mnemex-marketplace
```

> [!TIP]
> Requirements: Python 3.9+. `pip install openmnemex` brings everything the Console and engine
> need ([`PyYAML`](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) plus FastAPI/uvicorn for the Console — the
> engine itself runs on the standard library + PyYAML alone). If something is missing, the Mnemex
> commands report it and tell you what to install rather than failing cryptically.

A complete walkthrough — from install to daily usage, with the hooks that fire automatically — is in
[`docs/user-journey.md`](docs/user-journey.md). 🧭

### The CLI equivalents (scripts, CI, or terminal preference)

Everything the Console's Add agents screen does is also one command — it drives the exact same
installer. Claude Code gets the full plugin experience above; every other MCP-capable agent gets
the same read/capture/promote loop over the stdio MCP server. For step-by-step, per-agent
instructions (install → what changed → how to verify → which tier to expect), see
[`docs/agent-setup.md`](docs/agent-setup.md).

```bash
# 60-second start: create a local-folder graph, bind it, and pin it into the entry — zero prompts.
uvx openmnemex install --agent <agent> --init-graph --yes

# …or wire up the server against a graph you already have:
uvx openmnemex install --agent <agent> [--project|--user] [--pin-graph]
```

`--init-graph` is the no-decisions path: it proposes a plain local folder under your mnemex home
(no git remote, no credentials — it always succeeds), scaffolds it doctor-clean, binds it as your user
default, and pins that graph into the agent's MCP entry. Nothing to choose, no dead end on the first
read. `--pin-graph` **without** a graph now errors clearly instead of silently writing an unpinned
entry.

| `--agent` | Config written | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| `opencode` | `opencode.json` + `AGENTS.md` block + `.opencode/plugin/mnemex.ts` (auto-capture hook) | Full |
| `gemini-cli` | `.gemini/settings.json` / `~/.gemini/settings.json` + `GEMINI.md` block | Assisted |
| `codex` | `.codex/config.toml` / `~/.codex/config.toml` + `AGENTS.md` block | Assisted |
| `copilot` | VS Code `.vscode/mcp.json` (project scope only — no static user-scope file) | Assisted |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/mcp.json` + `.cursor/rules/mnemex.mdc` | Assisted |
| `claude-code` | `.mcp.json` (project) or `claude mcp add` (user) — an alternative to the plugin above | Full |

"Assisted" tier means the host has to be told the read/capture/promote judgment procedure via the
instruction file (`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md`/rules block) rather than getting it as a Claude Code skill —
see [`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md) for exactly what differs. `--pin-graph` bakes the current
directory's resolved graph path into the server config so the agent doesn't need to `cd` there first;
add `--dry-run` to preview the diff or `--check` to verify an existing install; `--uninstall` removes
exactly the Mnemex entry/block and leaves everything else in the file untouched.

> [!NOTE]
> [`openmnemex` is on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openmnemex/) — `uvx openmnemex` and
> `pip install openmnemex` just work. To run the bleeding edge straight from this repo instead:
> `uvx --from git+https://github.com/kritird/OpenMnemex openmnemex`.

JS-native users can skip `uv`/`pip` entirely once published: `npx openmnemex install --agent
<agent> ...` and `npx openmnemex-mcp` are thin shims that exec the same PyPI package underneath
(`integrations/npm/`, the npm side is not yet published).
